# Morenex Base Theme (Bold Modern Minimal)

This is a starter Shopify theme skeleton intended for Morenex Virtual Solutions.
It includes placeholder sections and a modern Bold Minimal aesthetic.

## What you'll find
- theme.liquid layout
- essential sections (hero, marquee, collections, products carousel, testimonials, etc.)
- snippets for product cards and reviews
- basic CSS/JS placeholders
- JSON templates for Online Store 2.0

## How to use
1. Download the ZIP and extract.
2. Customize sections in `/sections` and styles in `/assets/theme.css`.
3. Upload to a GitHub repo and connect to your Shopify store via "Connect from GitHub".
4. Replace placeholder assets and implement dynamic content as needed.

## Placeholder asset
A camera RAW image you uploaded has been copied into `/assets` as `hero-placeholder.dng`.
You should replace it with optimized JPG/WEBP images for production.

Happy building — want me to scaffold actual Liquid schema settings for one of the sections next?


Updated: Added detailed theme.liquid, theme.css, theme.js, and a Hero Banner section with schema.
